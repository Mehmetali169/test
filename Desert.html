                    The term dessert can apply to many sweets, such as biscuits,
                     cakes, cookies, custards, gelatins, ice creams, pastries, 
                     pies, puddings, macaroons, sweet soups, tarts, and fruit 
                     salad (fruit is commonly found in dessert courses because 
                     of its naturally occurring sweetness). Dried fruit and honey 
                     were probably the first sweeteners used in most of the world, 
                     but the spread of sugarcane around the world was essential to 
                     the development of dessert.[8]:13 Sugarcane was grown and 
                     refined in India before 500 BC[8]:26 and was crystallized,
                      making it easy to transport, by AD 500. Sugar and sugarcane
                       were traded, making sugar available to Macedonia by 303 BC 
                       and China by AD 600. In the Indian subcontinent, the Middle
                       East, and China, sugar has been a staple of cooking and 
                       desserts for over a thousand years.<h6<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dessert#:~:text=The%20term%20dessert%20can%20apply,of%20its%20naturally%20occurring%20sweetness."> more text...</a>
