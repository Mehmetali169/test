                         Chocolate is created from the cocoa bean. A cacao tree with fruit
                         pods in various stages of ripening. Roughly two-thirds of the entire
                         world's cocoa is produced in West Africa, with 43% sourced from Côte
                         d'Ivoire, where, as of 2007, child labor is a common practice to 
                         obtain the product.The Olmec, one of the earliest civilizations in
                          Latin America, were the first to turn the cacao plant into chocolate.
                           They drank an ancient chocolate drink during rituals and used it as 
                           medicine. Centuries later, the Mayans praised chocolate as the drink 
                           of the gods.
